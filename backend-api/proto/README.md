## üîß **Local Development**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- pip

### Setup
1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run locally:**
```bash
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Local Testing
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Player search
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/players/search?query=Mahomes&limit=3"

# Draft recommendations (use the same JSON payload as above)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/draft/recommendations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"n_teams":12,"rounds":15,"user_team_ix":0,"current_pick":1,"teams":[...],"taken_players":[]}'
```

## üöÄ **Deployment**

### Fly.io Deployment
The API is automatically deployed to Fly.io. To update:

```bash
# Deploy changes
fly deploy

# Check status
fly status

# View logs
fly logs
```

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)
- All other configuration is handled in `fly.toml`

## üìà **Understanding DAVAR Scores**

The **DAVAR (Demand-Adjusted Value Above Replacement)** score is the core metric:

- **Higher scores** = Better picks
- **Positive scores** = Value above replacement
- **Negative scores** = Below replacement level
- **Factors considered**:
  - Player PPG projections
  - Position scarcity
  - Team needs
  - Opportunity cost of waiting
  - Player survival probability

## üéØ **Usage Examples**

### 1. **First Pick of the Draft**
```json
{
  "n_teams": 12,
  "rounds": 15,
  "user_team_ix": 0,
  "current_pick": 1,
  "teams": [/* 12 empty teams */],
  "taken_players": []
}
```

### 2. **Mid-Draft with Some Players Taken**
```json
{
  "n_teams": 12,
  "rounds": 15,
  "user_team_ix": 5,
  "current_pick": 48,
  "teams": [
    {"picks": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Tyreek Hill"], "need": {"QB": 1, "RB": 1, "WR": 1, "TE": 1, "FLEX": 1}, "bench_total": 8},
    // ... other teams
  ],
  "taken_players": ["Christian McCaffrey", "Tyreek Hill", "Travis Kelce", "Saquon Barkley"]
}
```

### 3. **Late Draft with Specific Team Needs**
```json
{
  "n_teams": 12,
  "rounds": 15,
  "user_team_ix": 0,
  "current_pick": 120,
  "teams": [
    {"picks": ["QB1", "RB1", "RB2", "WR1", "WR2", "TE1"], "need": {"QB": 0, "RB": 0, "WR": 0, "TE": 0, "FLEX": 0}, "bench_total": 8},
    // ... other teams
  ],
  "taken_players": [/* all drafted players */]
}
```

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

1. **"list index out of range"**
   - Ensure you provide exactly `n_teams` team objects
   - All teams must have the same structure

2. **"KeyError: 'adp'"**
   - This was fixed in the latest deployment
   - If you see this, redeploy with `fly deploy`

3. **Validation errors**
   - Check that all required fields are present
   - Ensure data types match the schema (integers vs strings)

### Getting Help

- **Check logs**: `fly logs`
- **Health check**: `GET /health`
- **API docs**: `GET /docs` (Swagger UI)
